N	Don't you think that's strange that Horno made it that far, leaving all these creatures behind him alive ? And he was supposed to be with 14 other inmates.
G	Yeah, something's wrong here. We need to figure that out, our survival might depend on it.
P	Ok, keep your eyes open, we have no choice but to keep going on from here.
