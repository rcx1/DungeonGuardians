G	It looks like we made it to the 6th level !
N	It seems there's nothing in the direct vicinity, so maybe we should assess the situation so far.
B	Yes, there's no way the prisoners are waiting for us by their own will.
N	I'm afraid that's true ; just remember what Romuald looked like in the Catacombs. Someone, or something, has changed them.
P	So what's your point ?
N	I'm not sure. Maybe they got help from someone in the Dungeon, and this someone forced some of them to stay along the way to protect the escape of the others.
P	That still doesn't explain why the monsters are alive and all the doors locked.
N	Whoever or whatever helped them must have some control over the Dungeon and its inhabitants.
G	I don't like the sound of that, but it might have some truth.
P	Ok, enough speculation for now, let's concentrate on our mission.
