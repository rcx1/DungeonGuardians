V	If you see this, it means you have a problem with your Registration Key.
V	If you bought the game, try to delete your Key and reinstall it.
V	If that doesn't help, contact us at {>ContactMG} with your Customer ID.
V	If you didn't buy the game, now is a good time to buy it, thank you ! ;-)
V	Once you have correctly registered your game, walk back to the stairs, and come here again. This wall should have disappeared !
