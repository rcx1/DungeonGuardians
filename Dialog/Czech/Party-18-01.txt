N	Hey guys, while we're getting deeper and deeper, I have been doing some thinking...
B	Oh dear.
N	Do you think this self-called Guardian could possibly be the Young Emperor ?
G	Hmm, if it's always the same person that leaves all these notes, and if the Young Emperor didn't die years ago, then I guess it's a strong possibility.
B	Maybe it's him, maybe it's not. But anyway, if he's in our way, either we'll kill him or he'll kill us, who is he doesn't have much importance.
P	That's correct, we'll be ready for him whenever he comes at us.
