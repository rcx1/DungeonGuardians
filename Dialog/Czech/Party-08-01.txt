G	Phew, glad to be out of the palace.
B	I thought we were going to die in there.
N	It surely has been a tough battle ! But thanks to your command, we made it out alive !
P	You're welcome, but without all your talents, we would not be here now.
B	Great, let's keep the big group hug for a bit later. I can smell the air is less stale here, I'm impatient to see the sunlight again.
N	We're still not at the exit, but it shouldn't be far from here : check out all this moss on the walls.
P	Good, but we might have more trouble waiting for us, just look ahead !
