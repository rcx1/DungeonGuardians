N	Unbelievable !
G	What ?
N	Can you see this dead young man ?
B	Sure, he's right under our noses, hard to miss him.
N	He looks exactly like the Young Emperor's portrait in my history book!
G	What ?
B	You mean we found the body of the dead Young Emperor ?
N	It seems so.
G	I guess he must have been embalmed; he looks like he's sleeping, not like he has been dead for the past 20 years.
B	Let me check something... *pop*... Cold as ice, he's dead, there's no ambiguity.
G	So that means he's not the Guardian ?
N	It would seem so...
P	I'm beginning to feel cold myself, let's move!
